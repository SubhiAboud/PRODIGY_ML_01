# House Price Prediction Project üè†üí∞

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. It is based on three main features:

1. Total square footage
2. Number of bedrooms
3. Number of bathrooms

## Contents

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Project Setup](#project-setup)
- [Using the Model](#using-the-model)
- [Model Evaluation](#model-evaluation)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Project Setup

1. Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/test.ipynb`.

## Using the Model

The project includes the following steps:

1. Loading and cleaning the data
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Outlier treatment
4. Feature engineering and transformation
5. Training the linear regression model
6. Making predictions using the model

## Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R¬≤). The current score is: [0.51].
